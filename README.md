Data Content
• The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll .
• Gallup World Poll: In 2005, Gallup began its World Poll, which continually surveys citizens in 
160 countries, representing more than 98% of the world's adult population. The Gallup World 
Poll consists of more than 100 global questions as well as region-specific items.
• The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors -
economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and 
generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in 
Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national 
averages for each of the six factors.
• Ladder score: Happiness score or subjective well-being. This is the national average 
response to the question of the evaluations.
• Logged GDP per capita: The GDP-per-capita time series from 2019 to 2020 using 
countryspecific forecasts of real GDP growth in 2020
• Social support: Social support refers to assistance or support provided by members of 
social networks to an individual.
• Healthy life expectancy: Healthy life expectancy is the average life in good health-that is to 
say without ireversible limitation of activity in daily life or incapacities-of the fictitious 
generation subject to the conditions of mortality and morbidity prevailing that year.
• Freedom to make life choices: Freedom to make life choices is the national average of 
binary responses to the GWP question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to 
choose what you do with your life?” ... It is defined as the average of laughter and enjoyment 
for other waves where the happiness question was not asked
• Generosity: Generosity is the residual of regressing national average of response to the 
GWP question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per 
capita.
• Perceptions of corruption: The measure is the national average of the survey responses to 
two questions in the GWP: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not” and 
“Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?”
• Ladder score in Dystopia: It has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages. 
Dystopia as a benchmark against which to compare contributions from each of the six 
factors. Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world's least-happy people. ... Since 
life would be very unpleasant in a country with the world's lowest incomes, lowest life 
expectancy, lowest generosity, most corruption, least freedom, and least social support, it is 
referred to as “Dystopia,” in contrast to Utopia

Content
The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll . The columns following the 
happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social 
support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life 
evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values 
equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the 
total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than 
others.
Conclusion
• All details have been made in order to decide how we can establish a relationship between 
the life ladder and all other variables. When all the contents were examined, it was observed 
that money was the parameter most associated with happiness![newplot (1)](https://github.com/HOSHANGI/World-Happiness-Report-Analysisi/assets/118753140/c12d225f-66c1-495c-8cbf-7fcc4681ec2a)
